But since the user says \"sargent halvar\", which isn't listed in visible_npcs as per the context given here (the context's visible_npcs are [\"npc_enemy\", \"npc_guard\"]), maybe there's a mistake here, but according to the problem statement, I have to work with what's provided.\n\nWait, the input is part of a text RPG. The player says \"i attack sargent halvar.\" So the intent is to attack an NPC named Sargeant Halvar. But in the context given, visible_npcs are [\"npc_enemy\", \"npc_guard\"]. Maybe \"sargent halvar\" is one of those, like the guard? For example, maybe the guard's name is Sargeant Halvar.\n\nBut since the problem says to prefer IDs present in context, and the context lists the visible NPCs as \"npc_enemy\" and \"npc_guard\", I have to choose which ID to use here. The user mentions \"sargent halvar\" specifically, so perhaps it's a particular NPC, but given the context doesn't list names, maybe we have to assume that the engine can handle it by using the name as part of the ID or something.\n\nWait, looking back at the tool definitions: for example, {\"tool\":\"attack\",\"params\":{\"target_id\":\"<npc_id>\"}}. So target_id is an NPC's identifier in the game's system. The context shows visible_npcs are [\"npc_enemy\", \"npc_guard\"], but they might have names associated with them. However, the problem here states that the user input uses a name (\"sargent halvar\"), which isn't present in the context's visible_npcs list.\n\nHmm, maybe the intended approach here is to map this to the attack tool with target_id as \"npc_guard\" because sargeant halvar might be the guard. But the problem says if ambiguous, choose most salient option or omit param. Wait, but the user specifies a name, so perhaps we need to use that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this game's context, the NPCs have IDs like \"npc_guard\" for the guard and \"npc_enemy\" for enemy. The player says \"sargent halvar\", which is probably the guard. So target_id would be \"npc_guard\".\n\nWait, but the problem states: \"Prefer IDs present in provided context\". The visible_npcs are [\"npc_enemy\", \"npc_guard\"], so these are the possible target IDs here.\n\nThe user's input says \"attack sargent halvar\". Since sargent halvar is likely the guard (as a common example), maybe we choose \"npc_guard\" as the target_id. Alternatively, if it's an enemy, but enemies usually have different names.\n\nBut given that the context has visible_npcs: [\"npc_enemy\", \"npc_guard\"], and the user mentions \"sargent halvar\", which is probably the guard (a common name for a military rank), so I think we should map to target_id as \"npc_guard\".\n\nTherefore, the tool would be \"attack\" with params {\"target_id\": \"npc_guard\"}.\n\nWait, but the input uses \"sargent halvar\" as the full name. However, in the context, the visible_npcs are just their IDs (like npc_enemy and npc_guard), not names. So perhaps the game's system maps these names to the IDs internally. But according to the problem statement, we have to use the IDs present in the context.\n\nSince the user says \"sargent halvar\", but the context doesn't list that name, but has \"npc_guard\" as a visible NPC, maybe this is intended as the target. The engine might handle the name-to-ID mapping internally, but for our purpose here, we need to output the tool with the correct ID.\n\nGiven the guidelines: if ambiguous, choose most salient visible option. Here, the player is attacking Sargeant Halvar, so likely a guard (since enemy would be a different type). So target_id: \"npc_guard\".\n\nSo the JSON should be {\"tool\": \"attack\", \"params\": {\"target_id\": \"npc_guard\"}}.\n\nWait, but in the input it's \"sargent halvar\" with a space. Maybe the engine expects the ID to be exactly as the visible_npcs list. The context has \"npc_guard\" and \"npc_enemy\". So using \"npc_guard\" is the right choice here.\n\n\n{\"tool\": \"attack\", \"params\": {\"target_id\": \"npc_guard\"}}"
